# Memtester for SystemVerilog
SystemVerilog implementation of memtester 4

Original source code is available from https://github.com/jnavila/memtester.

# Compile and Simulation

Currently, it is only complied and tested under Cadence Xcelium Simulator. I've already tried Icarus Verilog and Verilator, but they aren't support class fully.
